        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          <code>Hello, World!</code> My name in the world is Alan. My formal training is in philosophy,
          linguistics, computer science and business, but my experience in these fields has led me to focus
          my attention on the Church, history, and how languages,
          communication, and art/music have taken shape therein.
          My day job is drawing cabinets (a kind of scribe, draftsman, engineer, contractor position).

          You may have previously encountered my work online though my <a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/">Miscellaneous
          Stuff Blog</a>. Here, I posted articles, diary-entry like
          things, and other content. Of particular interest is my documentation of my experience
          of the whole 2020 COVID narrative.
          Shortly after, I began a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnuRnvlG2zgqVd8F6Cs4XA">YouTube channel</a>.
          There, you'll find longer form content going over many relevant technology, society, language and communication
          topics including a commentary on Jacques Ellul's work <i>The Technological Society</i> (translated to English in 1964).

        <h2>Beyond me</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          On Great Saturday of 2022, I was baptized an <b>Orthodox Christian</b>
          in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) with
          <a href="https://www.goarch.org/chapel/saints?contentid=2496">St Porphyrios of Kavsokalyvia</a>
          as my patorn saint. In Slavonic style, I am called Porfiriy (ÐŸÐ¾Ñ€Ñ„Ð¸Ñ€Ð¸Ð¹). 
        </p>
        <h3>Seek and Ye Shall Find</h3>
        <p>
          If you
          have problems with "Christianity" as you have encountered it,
          I encourage you to look into the history of whatever worldview
          you hold (whether it is the teaching of some organized religion
          or from your own reasoning) and consider why you
          regard this path as correct. Or, maybe you have just found yourself
          following the "path of least resistance" and are not particularly
          attached to the teachings you've been given. Many <em>different</em>
          things have been called by the <em>same</em> terms and often to
          understand some one term it is necessary to study a <em>whole system!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as different people might mean very different things when
          they speak of "success" (or "love" or "happiness") so too we
          can see how the words we use depend on how we understand
          them&mdash;more words can often multiply confusion rather than
          bring clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do we sort through all the different teachings of the world, our
          own opinions and biases, and pressure from all different directions
          to do all sorts of different things? This was one place I started
          from&mdash;looking at various different teachings, what they claim
          to be true, and how they know that to be the case...
        </p>
        <h3>
          Ongoing Projects
        </h3>
        <p>
          Beyond Church and my day job, I am involved in a number of projects.
          It is a goal of mine to make every activity I do somehow be "beyond me"
          and include others. It is good to do things together.
        </p>

            As a person of Chinese ethnic lineage, I first studied the civilizations of East Asia
            before becoming reborn as a Half-Greek, Half-Russian, Exiled to the West.
            Now I buy take-out Chinese food for Nords who have watched more anime than me.
            I am working on seeing if other students of East Asian languages/cultures are
            interested in standardizing some materials to study (translations of Scripture,
            prayers, and more) so that we may speak the same idiom.

        <h2>Developer stuff</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, I've worked on closed source projects in React and
          Angular for work. On my own, I've studied a whole bunch of programming and
          computer science topics, including statistics and data science stuff to see what
          the "cuttinge edge" has to hold. See
          my <a href="https://github.com/captainalan">Github</a>
          and <a href="https://gist.github.com/captainalan">Github
          gists</a> for my most recent (open source) practice/work.
          Since 2021 or so, seeing how many technology companies were at the forefront
          of promoting policies/practices I oppose (namely, building up of the 
          bio-medical security state), I've largely stepped away from pursuing a
          tech-related career though I retain the knowledge I've gained from working
          in web development and studying technology related topics for many years.
